Adhoc Testing: To understand the application "http://computer-database.gatling.io/computers"

Assumptions: 
1. Test Data would remain same
2. No Adhoc data inserted aprart from test


### caveat: 
- Instead of having all the Test in UI, Most of them can be automated using backend API, as the test would be faster as well as reliable
- Due to the time constrain, test cases are defined in single line and not all test cases have been automated
- Specflow Project created, however, it's not ready for execution
